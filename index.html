      <h3>A Penny for Your Thoughts</h3><br>
      <p>Last year, a company in the business of collecting consumers’ personal information and selling it to organizations made over a quarter billion dollars in annual revenue.
      </p><br>

      <p>As data brokers like Acxiom have discovered, there’s a high demand for consumer data. Finding out what, where, when, and how various demographics make decisions in different geographical regions helps companies improve on artificial intelligence
        technology, target marketing tactics, and user experience. However, the practice entails gathering IP addresses, shared pictures, and private messages, and an insufficient coverage of consumer rights has given companies the opportunity to collect
        this data with minimal restrictions and repercussions.
      </p><br>

      <p>While the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974 controls how government agencies collect personally identifiable information (PII), and a number of states have enacted privacy legislation, no federal legislation currently exists to address how the private sector
        can collect consumer data. The Federal Trade Commission Act is the closest the U.S. has come, but it wasn’t designed specifically with data privacy in mind. The FTC Act has enforced companies’ privacy policies, but doesn’t have language that requires
        companies to put those privacy policies in place.
      </p><br>

      <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xOJuT/3/" target="_blank"><img id="map" src="images/map.png"></a><br>

      <p>When national laws fall short, as they do for data collection, consumer-facing companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google look to state laws or industry “best practices” to govern.</p><br>

      <p>In her study about “the privacy paradox” – a term referring to the disconnect between an individual’s privacy standards and behavior – Susan Athey looks at the two concepts involved in forming any privacy-related policy: Notice and Choice. The former
        involves telling the consumer what data will be used before it’s taken, and the latter gives the user the option to accept those terms.</p><br>

      <p>While consumers are fearful of breaches, hacks, or anything else that involves data being taken from them without consent, they all too easily sign personal data away to companies for immediate gratification. Just ask the 1.37 billion daily active
        users on Facebook. Once a user clicks on that green button (click to see a full list of the data shared), Facebook has complied with both notice and consent.</p><br>

      <h3>The Cost of Being Cautious</h3><br>
      <p>Following the two largest data breaches in history, Yahoo and Equifax took steps to pacify the chaos, but those measures that a company takes to help consumers in the aftermath of a breach are never enough to protect an individual’s information.
      </p><br>
      <p>“It is a really scary thought and I think until you learn your lesson or have been exposed in that way, you'd rather not think about it,” said Abbey Brogan, a public relations specialist in New York City, who has had the good fortune of steering
        clear of such unwanted activity. “But maybe once you have, it's like ‘Okay, what lesson can I learn from that and how can I be more secure?’”
      </p><br>
      <p>There are plenty of personal security tools and services available to individual consumers, but the most effective come at a price and – even as more consumer-friendly products enter the market – require some technical knowledge.
      </p><br>
      <p>“In the realm of privacy protection and cybersecurity, there are a lot of different product offerings out there,” said David Zuckerman of Zuckerman Capital Management. “Behavioral finance has shown that when there is an overload of information,
        consumers often do nothing, and I do think that there is a fairly wide swath of the U.S. population that falls into that group.”
        <p><br>
          <p>The complexity of the topic would put a majority of the 77% of U.S. adults who use a smartphone in a more vulnerable position. For employees at companies with well-resourced IT teams, security precautions like encryption services are generally
            put in place to ensure employees are being safe, even on personal devices. But individuals without a high school degree, a little over half of who own a smartphone according to the Pew Research Center, are more likely to have to pay for security
            out of pocket, and less likely to have the education or personal experience to make security-conscious decisions.
            <p><br>
              <p>“I definitely don't do any technology-based protection,” said Ari Nordsten, a financial manager in San Francisco. Nordsten uses lengthy and complicated passwords, she doesn’t respond to spam emails, uses caller ID numbers instead of the
                numbers left in voicemails, doesn’t save passwords on her phone, and uses cash at locations she doesn’t trust. Still, she acknowledges that the more technical decisions are out of her expertise. “[Encryption is] out of work requirement,
                both on my phone and my computer and my iPad. VPN and extra password [changes] are things that would have never crossed my mind.”
                <p><br>
                  <p>For low-income consumers and blue collar employees, the choice becomes whether to save those dollars or to make security decisions they’re unsure of. For social media platforms, consumers have the affordable option of understanding the
                    associated terms and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/social-media/colleges-check-applicants-social-media-posts/" target="_blank">considering the repercussions</a> of publicly sharing data (although pay-for-play social media
                    cleaning services do exist). Cybersecurity, however, does involve investing in the proper tools and care.
                    <p><br>
                      <p>“I mean if I could be 100 percent safe forever on everything, I'd probably pay, I don't know, like $10 a month because that's akin to what I pay for renter's insurance,” said Nordsten.
                        <p><br>

                            <p>Your passwords should be long and complex, using every requirement allowed. That's easy if you have one password, but ideally each one will be different, and they <i>won’t</i> auto-fill when you open a website or application.

                              number of stored passcodes or the number of devices you can use it on. LastPass provides more than any other free service.

                            <h4>Keep your records closer with a VPN</h4><br>
                            <p>A virtual private network (VPN) is an encryption tool for internet traffic, that takes data directly from your device to a server, while avoiding unwanted eyes. When you sign up for a VPN service, the provider owns that server,
                              so you’ll want to pick one that’s well-known (for the right reasons, of course).</p><br>
                            <p>While some services <a href="https://spotflux.com/" target="_blank">have unsuccessfully tried</a> being permanently free via ad-support or limited bandwidth, paid services often provide a free trial. Many are wary of free VPN
                              services, with the assumption that the service is getting its money another way, e.g. selling the data that comes to its servers.</p><br>
                            <p>There is a free service included in the list below just for comparison’s sake, but experts agree that a free VPN service is probably too good to be true.

                            <p>Handling medical, banking, or social security information should be done in the privacy of your home network. If you don’t have internet at home, you’re in the minority. The number of U.S. adults with a high-speed broadband
                              service dipped in 2013 according to research from The Pew Research Center, but rose again in 2015 – the year Anthem and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management were hacked, each compromising tens of millions of employees’
                              data. By November 2016, 73% of U.S. adults were home broadband users.

      <h3>Looking Forward</h3><br>
      <p>"Data protection (and privacy management) has become a much larger problem than something consumers as individuals can address," Acquisti said in an email. "While, as consumers, we can do something, adequately addressing privacy has become a societal
        problem – one only solvable by a combination of regulatory intervention, broadly-reaching technological solutions, and individuals steps." </p><br>
      <p>To give future generations less to think about, there are lines that need to be drawn.</p><br>
      <p>At the highest level, federal legislation will help patch up holes left by state laws or industry-driven guidelines. At a lower level, companies can start considering the possibility of being hacked when making market-driving decisions, and companies
        leading the way in security can help by making privacy more affordable.</p><br>
      <p>But on the lowest level, it's up to us as consumers to make decisions that will help keep our information – and the information of our fellow consumers – secure.</p><br>
      <p>"As long as individuals around me are fully aware that like 'Don't click links in messages,' or 'I'm not sending you a message from Bank of America to validate my account,' that type of thing, there are things that I can do in the short term to
        protect myself and the loved ones around me," said House.</p><br>
      <p>There are free resources to help you along the way: Companies that aren't profiting from selling data to advertisers, and nonprofit organizations whose sole mission is to keep our data, ours. The most important thing to remember is that it won't
        work if it's a small population's effort. Encourage friends and family to use the applications and tools that safeguard your privacy <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/01/data-privacy-day-play-privacy-team-sport" target="_blank">for maximum impact</a>.</p><br>
      <p>At the bottom, you'll find a list of links to products and organizations to get you started. You can choose to donate money, or just promote the cause.</p><br>
      <p>But first, here are a few free tips on ways you can secure your family's digital footprint:</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>A fingerprint is more secure then a passcode, but if you must use a combination to get into your phone, use as many digits as your device allows. A four-digit passcode has 10,000 combination possibilities, but a six-digit passcode has 1,000,0000.
        </li>
        <li>Check your devices’ internet networks frequently to clean out the ones that you don’t use on a daily basis. You never know which one you might have logged into in a moment of haste that's been compromised since, or was already unsecure.</li>
        <li>“Another measure that a lot of consumers should take but may not necessarily be taking yet is 2-step-protection for important log ins,” said Zuckerman. Two factor authentification is required by some services, and optional on others, but given
          the option, you should us it. </li>
        <li>The “S” in HTTPS stands for secure, so if you’re on a website that isn’t using it, use caution. </li>
