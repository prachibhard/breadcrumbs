      <p>Over the centuries, guards, well-fashioned locks, alarms, and security systems, have been a luxury only the wealthy can afford. Today, the disparity is less about breaking and entering, and more about a lack of resources to protect your personally
        identifiable information.

      <h2>Privacy as a Privilege</h2><br>
      <p>Personal data in the wrong hands can put an individual's reputation, financials, and physical being at risk. This isn't limited to the rich and the famous. TK STATISTICS FROM BJS.</p><br>
      <p>Following the two largest data breaches in history, Yahoo and Equifax took steps to pacify the chaos. Unfortunately, the measures that a company helps consumers take in the aftermath of a breach – however affective in controlling the company’s image
        – are never enough to protect consumers' information.</p><br>
      <p>The government, on the other hand, does attempt to impose rules to prevent these crimes, but it takes longer to deploy legislation than it does to hack a database.</p><br>
      <p>Given the unreliability of these groups of people, it’s in a consumer’s best interest to take matters of personal security into his or her own hands. <strong>But data privacy doesn't come cheap.</strong> It's too small a category to deserve its
        own slice of the budgeting pie chart, but the level of technology required to get the job done effectively is going to become more expensive as the hacks become more complex. The prioritization of livelihood versus the price to keep information
        safe and secure is all the more complicated for low-income consumers.</p>

    <div class="section" id="companies">
      <h2>A Penny for Your Thoughts</h2><br>
      <p>Who's after your data anyway?</p><br>
      <p>How hackers profit from it.</p><br>
      <p>And how companies profit from it. After consumers use data to pay for "free" services (MoviePass, Sonos, Affirm), companies use it as currency, exchanging it to make themselves more valuable [market comparisons].</p>

      <h2>It Costs to be Cautious</h2><br>
      <p>Consumers have options. They vary in affordability, accessibility, and effectiveness, making the task of choosing one, intimidating. The concept's newness and complexity are both added obstacles, even for tech-savvy consumers.</p><br>
      <p>“In the realm of privacy protection and cybersecurity, there are a lot of different product offerings out there,” said David Zuckerman of Zuckerman Capital Management. “Behavioral finance has shown that when there is an overload of information,
        consumers often do nothing, and I do think that there is a fairly wide swath of the U.S. population that falls into that group.”</p><br>
      <p>Hearing that, it's easy for TK population of the world to consult the internet, an IT specialist, or just a well-read friend, but such resources further the disparity. The Pew Research Center found that TK percent of people have access to the internet,
        and according to TK, people with an understanding of this technology tend to have an income of TK or higher.</p><br>
      <p>If you think you have the money to spend, here are a few ways to get started if you haven't already. As you read a little bit about each section, select a product for that category, and watch as your level of privacy and the price you would pay
        in a year* change in the bar below. Of course, no combination of these choices will even get you to 100% privacy.

            <h4>Encryption is key</h4><br>
            <p>If your data is hacked, the files that you encrypt will be by far the safest. Reversing encrypted code is difficult for even a good hacker to do, so rather than removing yourself from the grid completely, find an encryption service for your
              most important files.</p><br>
            <p>For the purpose of this activity, all encryption tools are priced at 100 GB of storage.</p>

            <h4>Protect your passwords</h4><br>
            <p>Your passwords should be long and complex, using every requirement allowed. That's easy to do when you have one, but ideally each account is different. You can write these down or keep them in an encrypted document, but that gets tricky if
              you’re on the move. Password managers help you generate and store passwords in an encrypted database. There are free options, but make sure you consider your needs. Aside from lacking in some features, free password managers tend to limit
              the number of stored passcodes, or the number of devices you can use it on. LastPass provides more than any other free service.</p>

            <h4>Keep your records closer with a VPN</h4><br>
            <p>A virtual private network (VPN) is an encryption tool for internet traffic, that takes data directly from your device to a server, while avoiding unwanted eyes. When you sign up for a VPN service, the provider owns that server, so you’ll want
              to pick one that’s well-known – for the right reasons, of course. Again, paid services often provide a free trial, while others <a href="https://spotflux.com/">have tried</a> being entirely free via ad-support or limited bandwidth. Signal
              is a free encrypted app, but it can only be used for messaging. </p>

            </span>
            <p>Handling medical, banking, or social security information should only be done at home. If you don’t have internet, you’re in the minority. The number of U.S. adults with a high-speed broadband service dipped in 2013 according to research from
              The Pew Research Center, but rose again in 2015 – the year Anthem and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management were hacked, each compromising tens of millions of employees’ data. By November 2016, 73% of U.S. adults were home broadband users.</p><br>
            <p>“Those grab headlines get people’s attention, but I think that the disconnect is how to turn that need for better security and protection into action,” said Zuckerman.</p><br>
            <p>The items in this section aren't annual like the rest are. This is a one time payment for the hardware. The resulting total is how much you would pay in a year.</p>

      <h2>The Indirect Effects</h2><br>
      <p>The price of privacy trickles down to consumers from government decisions, too. Even if you're able to save up the money to pay for personal precautions, you're in danger of security breaches if you're not in a jurisdiction with the most well-resourced
        public schools, libraries, and hospitals.</p>
      <p>HIPPA is costly for hospitals to abide by...</p><br>
      <p>Public libraries depending on unsecure WiFi...</p><br>
      <p>Schools storing student records digitally don't always store them securely...</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="forward">
      <h2>Looking Forward</h2><br>
      <p>There are a lot of lines that can be drawn to give future generations less to think about, but the first step is to make privacy more affordable. Many of those lines are dependent on government decisions that we can help push for. At a lower level,
        companies can start considering the possibility of being hacked when making market-driving decisions. On any even lower level, however, it's up to us to make decisions that will help keep our fellow consumers' information secure. There are free
        resources that aren't profiting from selling data to ads, as well as nonprofit organizations whose sole mission is to keep our data, ours. There's a list of links to these organizations below – You can choose to donate, or just promote the cause.
        In the meantime, here are a few free tips on ways you can secure your family's digital footprint:</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>A fingerprint is more secure then a passcode, but if you must use a combination to get into your phone, use as many digits as your device allows. A four-digit passcode has 10,000 combination possibilities, but a six-digit passcode has 1,000,0000.
        </li>
        <li>Check your devices’ internet networks frequently to clean out the ones that you don’t use on a daily basis. You never know which one you might have logged into in a moment of haste that has been compromised since or was already unsecure.</li>
        <li>“Another measure that a lot of consumers should take but may not necessarily be taking yet is 2-step-protection for important log ins,” said Zuckerman. Two factor authentification is required by some services, and optional on others. When it's
          optional, use it. </li>
        <li>The “S” in HTTPS stands for secure, so if you’re on a website that isn’t using it, use caution. </li>
      </ul><br><br>
