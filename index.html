      <p>Over the centuries, guards, well-fashioned locks, alarms, and security systems, have been a luxury only the wealthy can afford. Today, the disparity is less about breaking and entering, and more about a lack of resources to protect your personally
        identifiable information.

      <h2>Privacy as a Privilege</h2><br>
      <p>Personal data in the wrong hands can put an individual's reputation, financials, and physical being at risk. Contrary to common thinking, this isn't limited to the rich and the famous. STATISTICS FROM BJS.</p>
      <p>Following the two largest data breaches in history, Yahoo and Equifax took steps to pacify the chaos. Unfortunately, the measures that a company helps consumers take in the aftermath of a breach – however affective in controlling the company’s image
        – are never enough to protect consumers' information. The government imposes rules to try and prevent these crimes, but a digital footprint is more complicated than a real one, and it takes longer to deploy legislation than it does to hack a database.
        It’s in a consumer’s best interest, then, to take matters of personal security into his or her own hands.</p>
      <p>But data privacy doesn't come cheap. And even though it's too small a category to deserve its own slice of the budgeting pie chart, the level of technology required to do it affectively is going to become more expensive as the hacks become more
        complex. This combination of truths – the prioritization of livelihood and the price to keep information safe and secure – is all the more dangerous for low-income consumers.</p>

      <h2>It Costs to be Cautious</h2><br>
      <p>Consumers have options. They vary in affordability, accessibility, and effectiveness, making the task of choosing one all the more intimidating. An added obstacle is that it's a relatively new and complex concept, even for tech-savvy consumers.</p><br>
      <p>“In the realm of privacy protection and cybersecurity, there are a lot of different product offerings out there,” said David Zuckerman of Zuckerman Capital Management. “Behavioral finance has shown that when there is an overload of information,
        consumers often do nothing, and I do think that there is a fairly wide swath of the U.S. population that falls into that group.”</p><br>
      <p>Hearing that, it's easy for TK population of the world to consult the internet, an IT specialist, or just a well-read friend, but these resources further the disparity. TK says that TK people have access to the internet. According to TK, people
        with an understanding of this technology tend to have an income of TK.</p><br>
      <p>Here are a few ways to get started. After you read a little bit about each section, select a product for that category. Watch as your level of privacy and the price you would pay in a year* change in the bar below. Of course, no combination of these
        choices will get you to 100% privacy.

            <h4>Encryption is key</h4><br>
            <p>“Even the most well-informed and well-intentioned consumers will only have a limited degree of control over what will happen to their data,” said Alessandro Acquisti, an information technology and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon
              University.
            </p><br>
            <p>But if your data is hacked, the files that you encrypt will be by far the safest. Reversing encrypted code is difficult for even a good hacker to do, so rather than removing yourself from the grid completely, find an encryption service for
              your most important files.</p><br>
            <p>For the purpose of this activity, all encryption tools are priced at 100 GB of storage.</p>

            <h4>Protect your passwords</h4><br>
            <p>Your passwords should be long and complex, using every requirement allowed. That's easy to do when you have one, but ideally each account is different. You can write these down or keep them in an encrypted document, but that gets tricky if
              you’re on the move. Password managers help you generate and store passwords in an encrypted database. There are free options, but make sure you consider your needs. Aside from lacking in some features, free password managers tend to limit
              the number of stored passcodes, or the number of devices you can use it on. LastPass provides more than any other free service.</p>

            <h4>Keep your records closer with a VPN</h4><br>
            <p>A virtual private network (VPN) is an encryption tool for internet traffic, that takes data directly from your device to a server, while avoiding unwanted eyes. When you sign up for a VPN service, the provider owns that server, so you’ll want
              to pick one that’s well-known – for the right reasons, of course. Again, paid services often provide a free trial, while others <a href="https://spotflux.com/">have tried</a> being entirely free via ad-support or limited bandwidth. Signal
              is a free encrypted app, but it can only be used for messaging. </p>

            <p>Handling medical, banking, or social security information should only be done at home. If you don’t have internet, you’re in the minority. The number of U.S. adults with a high-speed broadband service dipped in 2013 according to research from
              The Pew Research Center, but rose again in 2015 – the year Anthem and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management were hacked, each compromising tens of millions of employees’ data. By November 2016, 73% of U.S. adults were home broadband users.</p><br>
            <p>“Those grab headlines get people’s attention, but I think that the disconnect is how to turn that need for better security and protection into action,” said Zuckerman.</p><br>
            <p>The items in this section aren't annual like the rest are. This is a one time payment for the hardware. The resulting total is how much you would pay in a year.</p>
