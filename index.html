      <h3>A Penny for Your Thoughts</h3><br>
      <p>Companies across industries are willing to pay large sums of money for information about what, where, when, and how people from various demographics and geographical regions make the decisions that they make. In an ideal world, this demand for consumer
        information would put consumers at a huge advantage.</p>

      <p>Instead, a lack of consumer rights in the U.S. has given corporations an opportunity to obtain user data with minimal restrictions and repercussions.</p>

      <p>While the U.S. Privacy Act of 1974 controls how government agencies collect personally identifiable information (PII), and a number of states have enacted privacy legislation, no federal legislation currently exists to address how the private sector
        can collect consumer data. The Federal Trade Commission Act is the closest the U.S. has come, but it wasn’t designed specifically to address the private sector. It has been used to enforce companies’ privacy policies, but doesn’t have language
        that requires companies to put those privacy policies in place.</p>

      <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xOJuT/3/"><img src="images/map.png"></a>

      <p>When national laws fall short, as they do for data collection, consumer-facing companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google look to state laws or industry “best practices” to govern.</p>

      <p>In her study about “the privacy paradox” – a term referring to the disconnect between an individual’s privacy standards and behavior – Susan Athey looks at the two concepts involved in forming any privacy-related policy: Notice and Choice. The former
        involves telling the consumer what data will be used before it’s taken, and the latter gives the user the option to accept those terms.</p>

      <p>While consumers are fearful of breaches, hacks, or anything else that involves data being taken from them without consent, they all too easily sign personal data away to companies for immediate gratification. Just ask the 1.37 billion daily active
        users on Facebook. Once a user clicks on that green button (click to see a full list of the data shared), Facebook has complied with both notice and consent.</p>

      <h3>The Costs of Being Cautious</h3><br>
      <p>Consumers have options. They vary in affordability, accessibility, and effectiveness, making the task of choosing one, intimidating. The concept's newness and complexity are both added obstacles, even for tech-savvy consumers.</p><br>
      <p>“In the realm of privacy protection and cybersecurity, there are a lot of different product offerings out there,” said David Zuckerman of Zuckerman Capital Management. “Behavioral finance has shown that when there is an overload of information,
        consumers often do nothing, and I do think that there is a fairly wide swath of the U.S. population that falls into that group.”</p><br>
      <p>Hearing that, it's easy for TK population of the world to consult the internet, an IT specialist, or just a well-read friend, but such resources further the disparity. The Pew Research Center found that TK percent of people have access to the internet,
        and according to TK, people with an understanding of this technology tend to have an income of TK or higher.</p><br>
      <p>If you think you have the money to spend, here are a few ways to get started if you haven't already. As you read a little bit about each section, select a product for that category, and watch as your level of privacy and the price you would pay
        in a year* change in the bar below. Of course, no combination of these choices will even get you to 100% privacy.

            <h4>Encryption is key</h4><br>
            <p>If your data is hacked, the files that you encrypt will be by far the safest. Reversing encrypted code is difficult for even a good hacker to do, so rather than removing yourself from the grid completely, find an encryption service for your
              most important files.</p><br>
            <p>For the purpose of this activity, all encryption tools are priced at 100 GB of storage.</p>

            <h4>Protect your passwords</h4><br>
            <p>Your passwords should be long and complex, using every requirement allowed. That's easy to do when you have one, but ideally each account is different. You can write these down or keep them in an encrypted document, but that gets tricky if
              you’re on the move. Password managers help you generate and store passwords in an encrypted database. There are free options, but make sure you consider your needs. Aside from lacking in some features, free password managers tend to limit
              the number of stored passcodes, or the number of devices you can use it on. LastPass provides more than any other free service.</p>

            <h4>Keep your records closer with a VPN</h4><br>
            <p>A virtual private network (VPN) is an encryption tool for internet traffic, that takes data directly from your device to a server, while avoiding unwanted eyes. When you sign up for a VPN service, the provider owns that server, so you’ll want
              to pick one that’s well-known – for the right reasons, of course. Again, paid services often provide a free trial, while others <a href="https://spotflux.com/">have tried</a> being entirely free via ad-support or limited bandwidth. Signal
              is a free encrypted app, but it can only be used for messaging. </p>

            <h4>Invest in the hardware</h4><br>
            <p>Handling medical, banking, or social security information should only be done at home. If you don’t have internet, you’re in the minority. The number of U.S. adults with a high-speed broadband service dipped in 2013 according to research from
              The Pew Research Center, but rose again in 2015 – the year Anthem and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management were hacked, each compromising tens of millions of employees’ data. By November 2016, 73% of U.S. adults were home broadband users.
            </p><br>
            <p>“Those grab headlines get people’s attention, but I think that the disconnect is how to turn that need for better security and protection into action,” said Zuckerman.</p><br>
            <p>The items in this section aren't annual like the rest are. This is a one time payment for the hardware. The resulting total is how much you would pay in a year.</p>

      <h3>Looking Forward</h3><br>
      <p>There are a lot of regulatory lines that can be drawn to give future generations less to think about, but a good first step is to make privacy more affordable.</p><br>
      <p>At the highest level, we can push for federal legislation that can patch up any holes left by state laws or industry-driven guidelines.</p><br>
      <p>Looking at the mid-level, companies can start considering the possibility of being hacked when making market-driving decisions.</p><br>
      <p>But on the level closest to home, it's up to us to make decisions that will help keep our fellow consumers' information secure. There are free resources that aren't profiting from selling data to ads, as well as nonprofit organizations whose sole
        mission is to keep our data, ours. The most important thing to remember is that it won't work if it's a small population's effort. Encourage friends and family to use the applications and tools that safeguard your privacy for maximum impact.</p><br>
      <p>At the bottom, you'll find a list of links to products and organizations to get you started. You can choose to donate money, or just promote the cause.</p><br>
      <p>But first, here are a few free tips on ways you can secure your family's digital footprint:</p><br>
      <ul>
        <li>A fingerprint is more secure then a passcode, but if you must use a combination to get into your phone, use as many digits as your device allows. A four-digit passcode has 10,000 combination possibilities, but a six-digit passcode has 1,000,0000.
        </li>
        <li>Check your devices’ internet networks frequently to clean out the ones that you don’t use on a daily basis. You never know which one you might have logged into in a moment of haste that has been compromised since or was already unsecure.</li>
        <li>“Another measure that a lot of consumers should take but may not necessarily be taking yet is 2-step-protection for important log ins,” said Zuckerman. Two factor authentification is required by some services, and optional on others. When it's
          optional, use it. </li>
        <li>The “S” in HTTPS stands for secure, so if you’re on a website that isn’t using it, use caution. </li>
      </ul><br><br>
